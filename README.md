## TULPAMAKER: Your AI Companion Creator (v1.0)

**What is a Tulpa?**

A Tulpa is an intelligent being created through focused concentration and belief. While the concept originates from spiritual practices, TULPAMAKER uses the power of large language models to bring your Tulpa to life in a digital form.
